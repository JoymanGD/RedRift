####################INTRO:

I spent ~3 working days on it.

I used a few scripts (few managers from Scripts/Managers folder) from my common Unity template "WaldemGame" (written fully by me); btw a part of it was modified during this project.

####################REVIEW ENTRYPOINT:

The main class is HandManager.

####################SYSTEM: 
Game loading is faked since it wasn't in the task requirements but may be changed to async loading if needed (there is an instrument in IInitable I wrote during this project). ####################
